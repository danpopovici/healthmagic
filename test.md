The timing for the questions can be tailored according to the client's routine and preferences. They also need to be adapted over time based on the therapist's input, the client's feedback, and the insights generated by the AI system.

Please note that all the data collected needs to be handled with extreme care respecting the privacy and consent of the individual. The purpose of the AI is to aid in the process of therapy and not to diagnose or treat any condition by itself. This requires close collaboration and regular check-ins with the therapist.
